## Welcome to My Blog

This is the place where I will be publishing my project work as well as certifications and courses I'm currently doing. So, keep visiting my [site](https://mUmairNaxir.github.io) frequently to know what I'm currently working on.

## Projects currently working on:

### Apple scab detection and automatic pesticide/fungicide recommendation using CV and ML
● Prediction of apple scab detection using IBM Wastson API and OpenCV.
● Recommendation of timely remedial measures to be taken like pesticides/fungicides to be sprayed.

### Automatic helmet detection from live video recording at construction sites using CV and ML
● Detecting whether workers at condtruction sites are wearing helmets are not to mitigate the number of injuries that happen due to negligence


## My Major Projects
Following is the list of projects I have completed over the course of my undergrad studies and work experience:

### PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) Analysis…a machine learning approach 
● Prediction of potential risk indicators leading to the occurrence of PTSD. A case study from Kashmir. 
● Prediction of morbidity of PTSD occurrence immediately after facing a trauma. 
● Impact: Improved analytical studies regarding PTSD analysis in Kashmir. 

### Two States…a city comparator 
● Developed a web platform for comparing two cities around the country. 
● Helpful in identification of changes a person is going to incur while relocating from one city to another. 
● Factors compared: Weather, Cost of Living, Transport, Healthcare, Culture, and Tourism etc. ● Got Best project award of the batch for the same. 

### CalcoTester

A java-based calculation enhancing and logic building game. A simple but an interactive and fun-to-play game.


### eAttendance

An Android-based attendance app, wherein a teacher can attend his all classes in one app.
The data is stored in the android device itself besides storage at a cloud platform or backed up in your email account.
From percentage to shortage to anything in between, everything is calculated automatically and updated instantly at each instance of the class being attended.

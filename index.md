## Welcome to My Github Web Page

This is the place where I will be publishing changes in my projects As soon as I'm done with them. So, keep visiting my [site](https://mUmairNaxir.github.io) frequently to synchonise your work with mine.


##My current Projects
Presently I'm working on following two projects:

###CalcoTester

A java-based calculation enhancing and logic building game. A simple but an interactive and fun to play game.


###eAttendance

An Android-based attendance app, wherein a teacher can attend his all classes in one app.
The data is stored in the android device itself besides storage at a cloud platform or backed up in your email account.
From percentage to shortage to anything in between, everything is calculated automatically and updated instantly at each instance of the class being attended.
